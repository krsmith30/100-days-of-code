# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 04: April 5, 2018
**Progress**: Finalized all text and images I want in site. I think I finalized the layout. Need to add background color of black and text color of gold... not sure how to do that. 

**Thoughts**: Frustrated because I can't remember how to change the background and text color, which seems like such a simple thing to do. 

Day 03: April 4, 2018
**Progress**: Continued adding text. Played around with layout of images and text 

Day 02: April 3, 2018 

**Progress**: Added all text I want on the site and threw in a couple images I want to use. Need to add color and figure out how to use movie reel image as background on the heading. 

**Thoughts**: Still think it's fun! I have been googling things to get it to look exactly how I want. 

**Link to work**: same as yesterday. 


Day 01: April 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Theme/idea for tribute page for free code camp. I put most of the info I want on there and will work over the next few days to make it look fancy

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed at first- didn't know where to begin. Looked at some examples I found on twitter and read over my notes from the courses. Now that I have somewhat of an outline, I'm totally excited to get it going!

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
