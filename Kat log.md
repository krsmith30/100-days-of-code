# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 09: April 10

**Progress**: Finished portfolio site 

**Thoughts**: Glad it's done! Happy with how it turned out, but have some tweaks to make still. 


Day 08: April 9, 2018- forgot to document yesterday

**Progress**: Got all content on portfolio. Added background colors and text colors. Need to add image of me, image of work samples, change font and should be done! 

**Thoughts**: Happy it's almost done- really like the look of it.

Day 06: April 7, 2018

**Progress**: Added social links, about me to portfolio. Tweaked other small things. 

**Thoughts**: This is going to take forever! Happy I'm learning it and it makes more sense the more work I do. 


Day 05: April 6, 2018

**Progress**: Started work on my personal portfolio for FCC. Created nav bar. 

**Thoughts**: Overwhelmed by how large this project is. I think it's going to take me a loooooong time. I've looked at examples on Codepen and am very scared by the amount of code it takes to create this site. I'm still excited to learn it, but it's scary. 

Day 04: April 5, 2018

**Progress**: Finalized all text and images I want in site. I think I finalized the layout. Need to add background color of black and text color of gold... not sure how to do that. 

**Thoughts**: Frustrated because I can't remember how to change the background and text color, which seems like such a simple thing to do. 

Day 03: April 4, 2018

**Progress**: Continued adding text. Played around with layout of images and text 

Day 02: April 3, 2018 

**Progress**: Added all text I want on the site and threw in a couple images I want to use. Need to add color and figure out how to use movie reel image as background on the heading. 

**Thoughts**: Still think it's fun! I have been googling things to get it to look exactly how I want. 

**Link to work**: same as yesterday. 


Day 01: April 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Theme/idea for tribute page for free code camp. I put most of the info I want on there and will work over the next few days to make it look fancy

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed at first- didn't know where to begin. Looked at some examples I found on twitter and read over my notes from the courses. Now that I have somewhat of an outline, I'm totally excited to get it going!

Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
